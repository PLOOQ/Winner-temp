To whom it may concern,

Please accept this message as a medium to convery my motives. This is a project that I have been working on for a very long time and I would like to keep the source code private for now. I do have a private repository on GitHub and I am more than willing to show the interface of the project for interview purposes on my local server. I am currently on the process of deploying this app on AWS. I successfully deployed the React.js frontend through AWS Amplify and the Django backend is in the works. Please contact me regarding this so we can further discuss this project. 

Best,

Pablo Loo-Quintero
